//Sales Analysis instructions
//You are given a list of items sold in a store.

//Each item is represented as a string with the item name and its price separated by a colon, like Apple:2.5.

//Write a program that parses these strings and calculates the total income from all the sales.

//Make sure to use const to represent the separator character (colon), and readonly to store the list of items sold.

//The program should also handle edge cases such as incorrect formats, negative prices, and missing prices.
