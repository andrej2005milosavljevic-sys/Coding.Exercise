//In this exercise, you are tasked to implement a class named WeatherDataAnalyzer with a method called Analyze.

//The Analyze method takes a list of tuples representing weather data as its parameter. Each tuple contains three integer values:

//Day: the day of the month.

//MinTemp: the minimum temperature recorded for the day.

//MaxTemp: the maximum temperature recorded for the day.

//The method should analyze this data and return a tuple containing three values:

//Day: the day with the greatest temperature swing (difference between max and min temperature).

//TempRange: the range of temperature swing for that day.

//IsUnusual: a boolean value indicating whether the temperature swing is considered unusual. A temperature swing larger than 15 degrees is considered unusual.

//The Analyze method should return the day with the highest temperature swing. In case of multiple days with the same temperature swing, return the day that appears first.

//If the weather data list is empty or none of the days have a valid temperature range, return a tuple with Day and TempRange as 0 and IsUnusual as false.

//Your implementation should make use of LINQ for processing the list and Pattern Matching to filter and transform the data. The result should be returned as a tuple.
